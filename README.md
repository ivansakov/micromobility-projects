# micromobility-projects

- This repository contains projects related to the analysis and potential development of micromobility in cities in Sweden.



Micromobility refers to the use of lightweight and environmentally-friendly transportation modes such as bicycles, electric scooters, and walking.

Micromobility focuses on providing convenient and sustainable alternatives to traditional car travel, particularly for short trips.

By embracing and enhancing micromobility or soft mobility, cities can create more sustainable transportation systems, reduce environmental impacts, enhance public health, and foster a sense of community.
