## Malmo project

### Prediction of e-scooter trip counts

- The first part of this project aims to develop a pipeline that can generate geospatial features from open data sources, such as OpenStreetMap and statistical agencies. These independent features, combined with observations of the number of trips from each h3 zone, enable the training of a model to predict the number of trips for other cities in Sweden.

- The second part of the project involves the process of training and validating various machine learning models. At this stage, we will use Random Forest and LightGBM models.
